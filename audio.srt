1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Learn English conversation. English conversation is quite different from

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,880
English reading. Conversation uses a different type of English, including

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,460
different vocabulary. English conversation vocabulary is much more

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,560
casual. In English, this means we use more words of Saxon or Old English origin

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:35,400
during conversation. We also use more phrasal verbs, two or three word verbs.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,680
The difference between conversation and more formal English is one reason that

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,400
even advanced students have difficulty with everyday conversations. The problem

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,040
is that students learn more formal English in school. Formal English tends

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,360
to use more words of French and Latin origin. This kind of English is, in fact,

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,280
much easier for students who speak romance languages such as Spanish,

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,400
Italian, Portuguese or French. These students often do quite well when reading

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,160
English but have a lot of trouble understanding normal speech. So, if you

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,200
want to communicate with native speakers, it's very important to learn English

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,160
conversation, not just textbooks and reading. To learn English conversation,

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,560
you must listen to more casual English and you must learn the different

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,040
vocabulary and patterns used in normal speech. In my lessons, I always focus on

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,600
real English conversation and I use the vocabulary of common speech. Another

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,680
great source of casual English conversation is film. Listen to American

19
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,560
English movies and read the subtitles. This will also help you.

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,520
Finally, Kristen, Joe, Tomoe and I are working on some very exciting projects. We

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,160
are recording real conversations with our friends and family. In fact, Kristen

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,720
and Joe are already finished recording over 30 real conversations. Next, we'll

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,080
send these recordings to be transcribed so you'll have the text for all of them.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
Then, we'll make lessons based on the vocabulary in the conversations,

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,800
including idioms and slang. For example, we'll use the listen and answer technique

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,160
to guarantee you learn the vocabulary and grammar deeply. These lessons are

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,600
scheduled to be released on November 1st. The title of these lessons is simple

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,480
and direct. We're calling them Learn Real English.

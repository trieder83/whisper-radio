0	6480	Learn English conversation. English conversation is quite different from
6480	12880	English reading. Conversation uses a different type of English, including
12880	19460	different vocabulary. English conversation vocabulary is much more
19460	27560	casual. In English, this means we use more words of Saxon or Old English origin
27560	35400	during conversation. We also use more phrasal verbs, two or three word verbs.
35400	41680	The difference between conversation and more formal English is one reason that
41680	48400	even advanced students have difficulty with everyday conversations. The problem
48400	53040	is that students learn more formal English in school. Formal English tends
53040	58360	to use more words of French and Latin origin. This kind of English is, in fact,
58360	63280	much easier for students who speak romance languages such as Spanish,
63280	69400	Italian, Portuguese or French. These students often do quite well when reading
69400	77160	English but have a lot of trouble understanding normal speech. So, if you
77160	81200	want to communicate with native speakers, it's very important to learn English
81200	88160	conversation, not just textbooks and reading. To learn English conversation,
88160	92560	you must listen to more casual English and you must learn the different
92560	99040	vocabulary and patterns used in normal speech. In my lessons, I always focus on
99040	104600	real English conversation and I use the vocabulary of common speech. Another
104600	110680	great source of casual English conversation is film. Listen to American
110680	116560	English movies and read the subtitles. This will also help you.
116560	122520	Finally, Kristen, Joe, Tomoe and I are working on some very exciting projects. We
122520	127160	are recording real conversations with our friends and family. In fact, Kristen
127160	133720	and Joe are already finished recording over 30 real conversations. Next, we'll
133720	138080	send these recordings to be transcribed so you'll have the text for all of them.
138800	142720	Then, we'll make lessons based on the vocabulary in the conversations,
142720	148800	including idioms and slang. For example, we'll use the listen and answer technique
148800	155160	to guarantee you learn the vocabulary and grammar deeply. These lessons are
155160	160600	scheduled to be released on November 1st. The title of these lessons is simple
160600	166480	and direct. We're calling them Learn Real English.

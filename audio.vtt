00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
Learn English conversation. English conversation is quite different from

00:06.480 --> 00:12.880
English reading. Conversation uses a different type of English, including

00:12.880 --> 00:19.460
different vocabulary. English conversation vocabulary is much more

00:19.460 --> 00:27.560
casual. In English, this means we use more words of Saxon or Old English origin

00:27.560 --> 00:35.400
during conversation. We also use more phrasal verbs, two or three word verbs.

00:35.400 --> 00:41.680
The difference between conversation and more formal English is one reason that

00:41.680 --> 00:48.400
even advanced students have difficulty with everyday conversations. The problem

00:48.400 --> 00:53.040
is that students learn more formal English in school. Formal English tends

00:53.040 --> 00:58.360
to use more words of French and Latin origin. This kind of English is, in fact,

00:58.360 --> 01:03.280
much easier for students who speak romance languages such as Spanish,

01:03.280 --> 01:09.400
Italian, Portuguese or French. These students often do quite well when reading

01:09.400 --> 01:17.160
English but have a lot of trouble understanding normal speech. So, if you

01:17.160 --> 01:21.200
want to communicate with native speakers, it's very important to learn English

01:21.200 --> 01:28.160
conversation, not just textbooks and reading. To learn English conversation,

01:28.160 --> 01:32.560
you must listen to more casual English and you must learn the different

01:32.560 --> 01:39.040
vocabulary and patterns used in normal speech. In my lessons, I always focus on

01:39.040 --> 01:44.600
real English conversation and I use the vocabulary of common speech. Another

01:44.600 --> 01:50.680
great source of casual English conversation is film. Listen to American

01:50.680 --> 01:56.560
English movies and read the subtitles. This will also help you.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.520
Finally, Kristen, Joe, Tomoe and I are working on some very exciting projects. We

02:02.520 --> 02:07.160
are recording real conversations with our friends and family. In fact, Kristen

02:07.160 --> 02:13.720
and Joe are already finished recording over 30 real conversations. Next, we'll

02:13.720 --> 02:18.080
send these recordings to be transcribed so you'll have the text for all of them.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.720
Then, we'll make lessons based on the vocabulary in the conversations,

02:22.720 --> 02:28.800
including idioms and slang. For example, we'll use the listen and answer technique

02:28.800 --> 02:35.160
to guarantee you learn the vocabulary and grammar deeply. These lessons are

02:35.160 --> 02:40.600
scheduled to be released on November 1st. The title of these lessons is simple

02:40.600 --> 02:46.480
and direct. We're calling them Learn Real English.
